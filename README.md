# Cryptocurrencies
### Exploring unsupervised machine learning with k-means on cryptocurrency data.

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use k-means algorithms and PCA to classify cryptocurrencies. Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Plotly, hvPlot There are 4 main parts to this analysis:
1. Preprocessing the data for machine learning
2. Using PCA to reduce dimensionality. PCA is useful here due to the large number of different hashing algorithms used by crpytocurrencies, which each would have been an ML feature)
3. Clustering cryptocurrencies using k-means
4. Visualizing results with 2-D and 3-D plots
